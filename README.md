# StorytelTest

This project is based on clean architecture and clean code.
 In this repository, I used NavigationComponent for a single activity.
 For API calls and asynchronous programming, I used Retrofit and RxJava.
 It has two fragments; one of them shows the posts and photos, and the following fragment shows three comments of the post with post detail.
 For testing, I used Junit5.
